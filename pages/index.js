                        With my very limited html knowledge, most of which was
                        learnt within an hour or 2 making{" "}

                            this website
                        </a>
                        , I have found react to be very intuitive and simple.
                        With the help of{" "}
                        <a href="https://github.com/EnderDev">this epic man</a>,
                        I was able to learn the basics of react in just 3 days
                        and I was able to make this basic but professional
                        website in preparation for my future collage assignment.

                        One good thing that stands out to me the most is how the
                        "id" and "className" work and how it can be called in
                        any file. I do most of my coding in the Godot game
                        engine and if I want to use a function from another
                        script I have to reference the script file path and save
                        it as a variable then call the function. However if I
                        want to add the className "main-container" to a div I
                        can just do that without having to reference
                        globals.css! All I need to do is import
                        "@/styles/globals.css" into the main app.js script and
                        it will be loaded for everything! This helps to stop
                        massive, ugly and un-optimized code such as this:
                    </p>
                    <img
                        width={"800px"}
                        height={"100px"}
                        src="/emojis/BadGodotCode.png"
                    ></img>
                    <p>
                        I don't even need a globals.css to reference it
                        anywhere, I can reference menu.css from anywhere if I
                        wanted to! Its only there for origination or for making
                        a program more secure as you can import the css file on
                        a per script bases so only menu.js can access menu.css.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One this I don't like about the class and ID system is
                        that if I want to give something specific specific
                        properties I have to make a new ID for each one. However
                        as I am typing this I have been informed by EnderDev
                        that for things like images I can set the width and
                        height in the same section that I can ID's and
                        classNames
                    </p>
                </div>
            </main>
        </>
    )
}
